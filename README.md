# planner
## Description
Completed
-- created github repo, cloned to local machine, pushed back to github
-- created java script file
-- used moment.js to bring in current date in jumbotron area
-- built out structure of the planner in html, tied to classes already built in CSS

Did not complete
-- assigning real times to each row (besides what i labeled manually in the html file) 
-- no input area
-- save button doesn't look good and is not functionable
-- no functions to determine color scheme of each row if current time is past, present, future, etc.

As always, took me awhile to figure out a good starting point.  Rand into a few bugs with upperCase vs lowerCase for the today moment().format() section of the JS file.  Think i was starting to figure this one out, but probably needed a ton more hours to finish it.
